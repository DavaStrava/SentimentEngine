# Product Overview

## SentimentEngine

A real-time multimedia sentiment analysis system that processes live video streams to extract emotional intelligence. The engine analyzes acoustic signals (vocal tone), visual cues (facial expressions), and linguistic content (transcribed speech) to generate a unified sentiment score that reveals the emotional context behind spoken communication.

## Target Use Cases

- Financial analysts monitoring live news broadcasts for market sentiment shifts
- Corporate communications managers tracking emotional tone during town halls
- Real-time decision-making in time-sensitive contexts requiring emotional intelligence

## Key Capabilities

- Multi-modal emotion detection combining audio, video, and text analysis
- Real-time processing with sub-3-second latency (target: 1 second)
- Continuous sentiment scoring normalized to [-1, 1] range
- Quality-aware fusion that adapts to varying signal quality across modalities
- Detection of emotional shifts and confidence indicators

## Current Status

This is a proof-of-concept MVP focused on core analysis capabilities with basic visualization. Future enhancements include alerting systems and external API integration.
