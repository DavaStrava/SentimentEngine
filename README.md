# SentimentEngine

Real-Time Multimedia Sentiment Analysis Engine - A proof-of-concept system that analyzes live multimedia streams to provide continuous emotional intelligence.

> **🚀 Want to try it now?** See [`START_HERE.md`](START_HERE.md) for a 2-command quick start!

## Overview

SentimentEngine processes acoustic, visual, and linguistic signals from live video feeds to generate a unified, real-time sentiment score. The system detects emotional shifts instantly—such as drops in confidence, spikes in excitement, or undertones of skepticism—transforming complex human emotion into actionable, objective data.

## Features

- **Multi-modal Analysis**: Combines acoustic (vocal tone), visual (facial expressions), and linguistic (semantic content) signals
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-3-second latency (target: 1 second)
- **Quality-aware Fusion**: Adapts to varying signal quality across modalities
- **Continuous Scoring**: Normalized sentiment scores in [-1, 1] range
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Detects shifts and provides confidence indicators

```

## Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download Models

```bash
python scripts/download_models.py
```

See `models/README.md` for detailed model acquisition instructions.

### 4. Start Redis

Redis is required for asynchronous frame distribution:

```bash
redis-server
```

### 5. Configure

Edit `config/config.yaml` to customize model paths, fusion parameters, and other settings.

## Testing the System

You have several options to test SentimentEngine:

### Option 1: Quick Demo (Recommended for First Test)

Run the standalone demo with synthetic data - no models or video files required:

```bash
python demo_simple.py
```

This demonstrates:
- All three analysis modules working
- Fusion engine combining modalities
- Graceful degradation when models aren't loaded
- Processing 10 synthetic frames with real-time output

### Option 2: Run Automated Tests

```bash
# All tests (unit + property-based)
pytest tests/

# Unit tests only
pytest tests/unit/

# Property-based tests only (100+ iterations each)
pytest tests/property/

# Specific test file
pytest tests/property/test_property_01_acoustic_completeness.py -v

# With coverage report
pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

### Option 3: Test with Real Video

Once you've downloaded the models (see Setup step 3):

```bash
# Process a video file
python src/main.py --input path/to/video.mp4
```

### Option 4: Run with Streamlit Web UI (Recommended!)

Launch the interactive web interface - **no Redis or video files required**:

```bash
streamlit run run_web_ui.py
```

The UI will open automatically in your browser at http://localhost:8501

**What you'll see:**
- Real-time sentiment analysis dashboard
- Acoustic, visual, and linguistic contributions
- Sentiment history chart
- Emotion breakdown
- Live confidence scores

**How to use:**
1. Click "🚀 Initialize System" (loads models, takes ~30 seconds)
2. Click "▶️ Start" to begin processing
3. Watch the sentiment scores update in real-time
4. Click "⏹️ Stop" when done

**Note**: This demo mode processes synthetic data to show you the system working. For real video processing, use Option 3.

### Option 5: Verify Setup

Check that all dependencies and components are properly configured:

```bash
python scripts/verify_setup.py
```

## What to Expect

### Without Downloaded Models
- System runs with graceful degradation
- Acoustic analysis returns low-confidence neutral results
- Visual and linguistic analysis work normally
- Fusion engine combines all modalities successfully

### With Downloaded Models
- Full acoustic emotion recognition (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- Enhanced confidence scores
- More accurate sentiment detection
- Better emotion category breakdown

## Architecture

The system follows an asynchronous, event-driven architecture:

1. **Stream Input Manager**: Ingests and decodes multimedia streams
2. **Analysis Modules**: Three independent modules process frames in parallel
   - Acoustic: Extracts vocal tone features and classifies emotions
   - Visual: Detects faces and classifies expressions
   - Linguistic: Transcribes speech and analyzes sentiment
3. **Fusion Engine**: Combines multi-modal signals with quality-aware weighting
4. **Display Interface**: Visualizes real-time sentiment scores

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Redis 6.0+
- GPU recommended for optimal performance
